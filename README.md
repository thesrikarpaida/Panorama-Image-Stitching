# Image-Stitching-Using-OpenCV

This is a simple panorama application for stitching together 2 images.

Detection of keypoints and extraction of local invariant descriptors in the images is done using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform).

The jupyter notebook also shows the code running RANSAC to estimate affine transformation and homography matrix.
