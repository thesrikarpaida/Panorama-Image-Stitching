# Image-Stitching-Using-OpenCV

This is a simple panorama application for stitching together 2 images.

We detect the keypoints and extract local invariant descriptors in the images using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform).

We also run RANSAC to estimate affine transformation and homography matrix.
